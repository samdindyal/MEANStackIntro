# An Introduction to the MEAN Stack

This is a web app created with the MEAN Stack as an introduction to it as a term project for a course, CPS530, Web Systems Development, at Ryerson University. This web app provides a brief overview of the MEAN Stack along with an example web application and a hello world tutorial including its deployment to Heroku.

This web app can be installed just like any other Node.js web application from the project's root:

```bash
npm install     # Install dependencies
```

and can be run from <code>server.js</code>:

```bash
node server.js  # Run it
```

The default port is 3000 and as for the database information, you may input your Mongo URI in the empty string on line 2 of <code>db.js</code> from the root of the project directory.
